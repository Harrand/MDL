use qcpl.bat to compile MDL into a DLL and an import library.

to use MDL, it's actually fucking easy as shit:
include mdl.hpp and use whatever you want from it.
then during compilation compile to a .o like normal (e.g you compiled test.cpp to test.o)
then use a command like this:
g++ -o test.exe test.o -L. -lmdl
so simply pass mdl dll directly. the implib is there too if not using g++
